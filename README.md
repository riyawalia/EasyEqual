# EasyEqual
Tired of writing repetitive object.equals to compare primitive and non primitive fields of every complex class you define? This application uses Reflection and Generic Types and allows you to simply generate &lt;T>.Equal for any class. It not only checks whether objects are of the same instance but also if they are different instances but equal with respect to field values.
